        <p class="text-center">
            Cybersecurity for government is of national importance as it not only is a matter of reputation but also a vital factor in balancing the public image of an individual. The latest political climate in the USA also stamps the fact that it can influence
            the election results as well.

                            <i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Over the past years, Cybercriminal groups, called advanced persistent threats (APT), have targeted the U.S. and European elections. These attacks have been attributed to Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear, two Russian government hacker joints. Typically, they target individuals with phishing attacks. They send out fake emails designed to deceive them into clicking on links that lead to entering or re-entering a password. In this way, malicious code is embedded, which helps them get control of all the confidential files and folders.

                            <i class="fas fa-circle"></i>During his first week as president, Donald Trump was still using his Samsung Galaxy S3 according to an analysis at Android Central. Because of its limited security requirements, it was constantly giving foreign agents access to Trump’s location or recording everything that was happening around it. Not only that, but the Twitter accounts of his advisors were also found to have poor cybersecurity settings, which easily gave away the email addresses associated with them. His only security advisor didn’t seem very qualified.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Politicians and people with political affiliations can have close-knit families. Believing that every destruction starts from home, hackers target their households, which includes bugging their devices with spying software. Then it takes only one step to give it all away. Not having two-factor authentication is just icing on the cake. <br /><br /> Just like any celebrity or influential person, political leaders are not aware of the cybersecurity of their digital assets. In June 2002, Fillery had hired a private investigator to collect confidential information about an ongoing murder investigation. The investigator got the associated Police officer’s home address, his internal payroll number, his date of birth, and some of his financial information. Even his voicemail and that of his wife, his computer, was also suspected to be accessed.
                        <br /><br /> Historical incidents like this find out how cyber hacking doesn’t spare a person’s family members either.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The most widely used and leading protocol for network communication is the SS7 protocol. But amazingly, it does not have a basic cyber protection system. Not only the carrier traffic is unencrypted, but also the device cannot spot an illegitimate command. Being an industry standard for decades, it is persisting with some outdated security concepts that cybercriminals leverage. It enables them to access the surveillance capabilities of intelligence agencies. <br
                        /><br /> Therefore, it becomes ever so simple for them to hack a politician’s phone because most known cyberattacks on mobile devices are based on operating system weaknesses. To protect against SS7 vulnerabilities, they adapt VoIP (voice-over application) instead of standard voice and SMS services with smart devices. Applications like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal also have other security vulnerabilities. <br /> Techforing’s holistic cybersecurity solutions can protect any cellular device from wiretapping and interception.

                            <i class="fas fa-circle"></i>For the last two decades, the internet has been being built on the HTTP protocol. Data exchange in plaintext wasn’t much of an issue, as there was no commercial activity. Mostly, top officials in the government and academic people used to share information. But with the change of times, the internet has now growingly become a hunting ground for cybercriminals. From a security standpoint, there is a lot to worry about now.

                            <i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Recently, the mayor of Tumpa was impersonated, which caused major chaos in the Tampa International Airport, just weeks before the Mayoral election. Others were historically defamed in their own blogs or websites with lines like “neXt Madoff of real estate”, “he is a liar, a thief. The people of x country deserve someone better” - statements that are uncharacteristic of the individual that gives the opposition party an upper hand to take him down. These are termed as “False statements” which make the public question his character, motive and ultimately misrepresent him as a person.
