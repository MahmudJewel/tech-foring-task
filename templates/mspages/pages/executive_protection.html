                        For many years, companies have been relying upon traditional network and endpoint security tools to be the go-to defenses. Heavy investments went into Anti-virus and firewalls, which have been protecting data to a reasonable degree. But the threat landscape
                        changes. Cybercriminals unleash ever-sneakier attacks that big corporations are scrambling to deal with. A cool-looking new smartphone app, a funny Facebook link, an unknown foreign website deceive the not so tech-savvy executives.
                        <br /><br /> Almost everyone agrees that a mix of defenses is crucial, even then some hackers slip through. On top of that, ever-evolving smartphones, the shift towards more data in cloud accounts provides new avenues for attackers.
