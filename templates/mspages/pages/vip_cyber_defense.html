            High Net Worth individuals and families or family offices are always a lucrative target for cybercriminals to commit cybercrimes. A study conducted in April during Covid-19, that states that 44% of workers are working from home. Operating remotely involves
            video conferencing service, remote working platforms, and virtual private networks. They use these to log in to their office servers and manage various financial and confidential matters. Through phishing, malware, and social engineering,
            Cyber attackers try to get into the financial accounts, email servers and even obtain personal information to perform identity theft.

                            You can significantly reduce some of these risks if you stay vigilant about your devices’ connectivity and exposure. Remember, you also have to create strong passwords that you can not by any means tell anyone or write down anywhere. All you can do is
                            to provide hints of it somewhere, even that is a risky business as well.
