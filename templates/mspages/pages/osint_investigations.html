                        OSINT investigations are searching and skimming out data from publicly available sources to gather intelligence about an entity. Businesses, organizations, and even individuals approach us looking for background information about someone, helping them
                        make a better decision.

                        The techniques and tools we use are not some hidden dark secret that borderlines its legitimacy. These are called overt methods used by intelligence agencies and other adversaries. There is a saying that the Soviet Union derives 90 percent of its intelligence from open-source intelligence. There are no covert collection tactics, impingement testing, undercover operation, hackings here. Everything is transparent and followed by the copyright and commercial requirements of our client.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The biggest challenge that Osint analysts face is the sea of information available in cyberspace. And it’s growing fast as more people are getting into the internet sharing their personal information. Thus, it increasingly becomes difficult to detect
                        and scrap out the most relevant ones manually. That’s precisely where people with good investigating eyes, analytical skills, and attention to detail come in handy. Otherwise, anyone could claim to be an Osint Analyst as more or
                        less everybody these days can search anything through Google, Yahoo, Bing. But little do they know that traditional search engines can’t always provide the required information. Moreover, it’s tricky to rely on all the information
                        sources as some of these might be outdated.
                        <br /><br /> So Osint analysts need to filter out a lot of it. Then, there is an issue of securing data to respect privacy. All these considering, anyone can share anything on the internet, but not everyone knows how to find the
                        right data at the right time.
