        <p class="text-justify">
            Celebrities are as vulnerable to cyber threats as any normal people are. It’s because of their precious fame and public image, they are more likely to be cyber hacked. They can be targeted in ‘spear phishing’. Scammers trigger an email or social media
            content made to look like coming from a regular friend and deceive them to give up personal or sensitive information.Especially mobile devices are more prone to phishing attacks due to their small form factor than PC.

                            News of the World voicemail hacking scandal made it clear that many people are not even aware of changing the factory default voicemail PIN number. Hence, most of the data leakage is executed in this route. Other than these, different passwords for different
                            online accounts and also setting the passcode feel like a massive hassle to media personalities. But they often forget how easy it can be for hackers to snoop in and get easy access to all the good stuff.

                            Do you know how dangerous is it to use public Wi-Fi? Especially if you are logging in to perform a financial transaction? These Wi-Fi signals often send data without any encryption. Therefore, it’s like sending a letter with an open envelope.

                            iPhone data is automatically stored out to iCloud. Even Android devices have Google photos-like platforms, which despite being a useful addition to their service, are still vulnerable to data leaks.

                            <b>Lastly</b>, a crucial security measure these famous people miss out on is using phones with security vulnerabilities. Modern phones need regular firmware updates, which often fix known security bugs. In this internet age,
                            anyone can become famous in the most horrifying way like images or strictly private content get leaked and put online. Most of the technicaldetails are even kept out of the records to avoid giving out the roadmap for future

                        During the Ashley Madison hack, attackers were mostly aiming at embarrassing people. They sent out millions of her clients’ emails online. The worry for the agencies that hired her is that compromise of her inbox can compromise many of their client-agency
                        personal exchanges. All in all, it’s a matter of mass defamation.
                        <br /><br /> Attackers often don’t have to put a personal touch to hook their prey. Fear of being exposed can be enough to make them take a desperate more foolish step. Resultantly, the cybercriminals break in and finish the rest
                        of the invasion.
