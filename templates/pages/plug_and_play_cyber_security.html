                  Organizations with serious cyber threats must implement AI through a well-thought-out, integrated strategy instead of adding additional capabilities bolted on to existing systems. To do so, we provide a multi-pronged Cybersecurity & Privacy Program. It’s a customizable Cyber Security Service tailored for small and medium-sized businesses that need easy access to the powerful controls. It aimed the controls at full circle data privacy dealing with complex issues associated with data collection, storing, disclosing, transferring, and removing.

                  Cybersecurity analysts gather necessary information on the existing system and detect fatal threats that can sabotage the security controls of the business. After vulnerability analysis, we report the amount of already spread exploitation and deliver actionable recommendations on the loopholes and potential threats that need immediate care. Each of the organization’s digital assets i.e. data center, mobile application, server and network, cloud infrastructure, and desktop application are thoroughly analyzed and assessed to ensure its overall safety.

                <p class="text-justify">
                  Generally, customer’s data needs to be protected from getting
                  freely available on the internet and unfortunately, it often
                  happens through a vendor breach. So, we step in with our
                  compliance program to ensure that a cloud vendor, or any
                  vendor with data access into the system, is as careful as you
                  with your data. In this process, high-risk vendors are
                  identified and your business cybersecurity is hardened.

                <h2>Incident Response Strategy</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                  Small businesses can’t plan for a sudden cyberattack as new
                  hacking techniques are evolving every day. They need to regain
                  control and mitigate future risks. We provide an incident
                  response strategy that encompasses a hack recovery plan,
                  malware removal, and digital forensic investigation. The
                  strategy is broken down into five phases, where we
                  predetermine guidelines tailored for your kind of business.
                  Then, the detection and reporting phase is initiated followed
                  by triage and endpoint analysis. Our cybersecurity experts
                  have in-depth knowledge of live system responses and memory
                  analysis. Using that, we finally contain and neutralize the
                  compromised system and provide incident reports.

                <p class="text-justify">
                  We are equipped with industry-based awareness training that
                  prepares IT, security representatives, to safeguard present
                  digital assets and train their users on secure operation
                  tactics. As the employees are the weakest link in the
                  cybersecurity chain, a timely awareness program goes a long
                  way in ensuring maximum protection of business data. To
                  achieve that, our training program consists of phishing
                  attacks, social engineering, general data protection
                  regulation, password security, ransomware, malware, and many
                  other security actions. To accommodate even the remote and
                  most job-occupied individuals, we have both online and offline
                  class systems, which they can attend at their convenience.
