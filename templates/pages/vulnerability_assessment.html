        <p class="text-justify">
          Most businesses take steps to evaluate their network security after experiencing an unfortunate event or because they are concerned about potential future threats. Active steps for prevention are better than any cure, and information security is no different. Any networked IT infrastructure is potentially vulnerable, so anyone managing a corporate or commercial network needs to know its weak points in order to address protecting it. We offer a unique approach to security and specifically to vulnerability assessment to protect your business from harm, secure it from intrusion, maintain the confidentiality of your data, and seclude commercial information from prying eyes.

                Best practices in information security acknowledge that a defensive-only approach to securing an enterprise does not suffice. Frequently, these existing defensive security mechanisms in place, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, are not configured properly or cannot locate all the vulnerabilities and threats on the network, especially at the device level. Performing regular security vulnerability assessment helps bridge the gap by allowing an organization to take a proactive stance towards protecting their information computing environment. The bottom-line aim is to safeguard the intellectual and electronic assets of the organization, and to ensure compliance with regulations.

        <p class="text-justify">
          We designed our vulnerability assessment services to test your organization’s internal and external infrastructure against known vulnerabilities and exposures. Once identified, you are able to efficiently fix the issues. Our first step is to study all the threats that apply specifically to you in your protected environment. We work from the point-of-view of an adversary. During this process, we figure out all potential avenues which adversaries might take to infiltrate, exploit, steal or attack your organization.

                  Social engineering is a non-technical intrusion into an
                  organization that relies on human interaction, often tricking
                  people into breaking standard security policies. We meet with
                  employees and stakeholders in your organization and learn
                  about your potential vulnerabilities. These interactions give
                  us a forum to measure acceptance levels of security procedures

                  Approximately 80% of security breaches occur from inside the internal network. This network breach assessment will analyze the risk to internal devices, such as servers, networking devices, VoIP, PCs, and other computer peripherals. Our cyber security experts shall then suggest specific techniques to resolve any concerns identified.

                  Both internal and external threats can cause data-stealing and
                  disrupting company operations. An external breach happens from
                  the vulnerabilities that may exist between a customer’s
                  external network and the internet. These include your internet
                  gateways such as firewalls and external routers, websites, and
                  cloud environments. Threats like these always speak to the
                  possibility of intentional abuse.

Our recommendations always address the three components of every security system: procedures, people, and technology. We delivered all of our findings and recommendations to you in a detailed report that you can use as a working document to remedy your security vulnerabilities. If needed, we can help you through any remediation process through ongoing consultation, implementation, training, and quality assurance services.

                  Penetration testing is a probing method that identifies security vulnerabilities in your network and the extent to which a cybercriminal could exploit them. Even though penetration testing is an independent assessment technique, we often combine it with vulnerability analysis to achieve a complete assessment. After completing a pen test for your business, we share our findings with your security team. Your team can use this information to implement security upgrades to fix any loopholes discovered during the test. Hackers always look for weaknesses and blind spots. Pen test locates these weaknesses.

                  Wireless technologies do not have the physical restrictions used in conventional wired environments. They make it possible for someone in the lobby, the parking lot, or across the street to have access to a network carrying sensitive financial or corporate data, personal or customer information, competitive data, or trade secrets.
